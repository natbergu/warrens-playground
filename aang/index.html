    <h1>Thanos: The Last Airbender</h1>
    <p>This is a good show! You should watch it!<br><br>
       	Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when Thanos kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Avengers and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Avengers attacked. Only Thanos mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless Avengers. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Avengers are nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Avengers, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that Thanos was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, Thanos will return to save the world.
